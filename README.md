A simple Git and GitHub demo for CS 407 Spring 2020.

# Steps
1. Fork this repository to your own GitHub account.
2. "git clone" your forked repository to your local machine.
3. Run "make all" to interact with the unfriendly computer.
4. Make the computer friendly instead by editing FriendlyGreeter.java to say something nice.
5. Run "make clean", then "make all" to see how friendly the computer became!
6. "git add --all" to add the new files you created (see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/572549/difference-between-git-add-a-and-git-add for different "git add" options and/or use the man pages!)
7. "git commit --all -m <your message here>", where "<your message here>" is whatever message you want to attach to your commit (again, either use Google or the man pages to find the different "git commit" options).
8. "git push" to send your local repository changes to the remote one. Make sure you have your GitHub login credentials on hand, since it may ask for them depending on how your machine is configured.
9. Visit your repository on a web browswer to see the new commits.

# Extras
1. Run "git pull" if you want to update your code with what's in your repository. This might be helpful if you are on a different branch and need to pull in changes that were made on a different branch.
2. Run "git branch" and/or "git checkout" to do branch operations (like create, delete, switch to, etc.). Look at documentation online or the man pages to get specific questions answered.
3. Try to create and switch to another branch, add another Java file that does something, and merge your new branch and the master branch back together.

As you use Git more often, you will inevitably run into issues. The Internent, man pages, and other humans will always help you troubleshoot these problems. Be curious and explore!
